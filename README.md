# Property Price Prediction using King County House Sales dataset
Buying a property is the most expensive purchase a person can make. People want to buy a property to live in it or invest in. Property can be used as long term investment stratergy. There may be lot of sentimental values associated with a property. However it is important to use rational thinking when purchasing a property. Otherwise a person can end up paying way more which will cost them a huge amount long term. 

I am going to use Data Analytics principle to estimate property price. This will give buyer comfort of knowing the property price is the right one or not. 
Ideally we should to use real world data. However, getting real world data can be challenge in itself.
For purpose of this project I am going to use King County House Sales dataset to predict the House prices.
This dataset may not be relevant for Australian property market, However once I create a model to develope a model the same model can be applied to real world data later on.
